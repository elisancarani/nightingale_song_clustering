# nightingale_song_clustering
This is a project for the "AI in Industry" lesson at the Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Bologna.

## The problem
Given an unlabeled dataset of nightingal songs, the aim of the project was to cluster the data in order to find the possible labels the data could be categorized with.

## Our Approaches
We tried two different approaches to tackle this problem. Our first approach was to employ and autoencoder, while the second one was to use contrastive learning, a self-supervised technique that allows a model to learn which data is similar and which isn't, by employing augmentation. For the contrastive learning approach we took inspiration from SimCLR, a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations.
